# Security Policy and Compliance

## Overview

The OVN Control Platform implements comprehensive security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with security best practices.

## Security Features

### 1. Authentication and Authorization

#### JWT-based Authentication
- Industry-standard JWT tokens with configurable expiration
- Secure token generation using cryptographically strong random values
- Token refresh mechanism to maintain sessions securely
- Support for token revocation

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Fine-grained permissions system
- Predefined roles: Admin, Operator, Viewer
- Custom role creation supported
- Resource-level permissions

### 2. API Security

#### Rate Limiting
- Multiple rate limiting strategies:
  - IP-based rate limiting with configurable limits
  - User-based rate limiting with role-specific thresholds
  - Endpoint-specific rate limiting for sensitive operations
  - Adaptive rate limiting based on system load
- Rate limit headers in responses for client awareness

#### Security Headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP) with nonce-based script execution
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) with preload
- X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking
- X-Content-Type-Options to prevent MIME sniffing
- X-XSS-Protection for legacy browser support
- Referrer-Policy for privacy protection
- Permissions-Policy to control browser features

#### Input Validation
- Comprehensive input validation on all API endpoints
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS prevention through proper output encoding
- Request size limits to prevent DoS attacks

### 3. Data Protection

#### Encryption at Rest
- Database encryption using PostgreSQL native encryption
- Sensitive configuration encrypted using AES-256
- Encryption keys stored in environment variables or secret management systems

#### Encryption in Transit
- TLS 1.2+ enforced for all communications
- HTTPS redirect middleware for HTTP requests
- Certificate pinning support for critical connections
- Mutual TLS (mTLS) support for service-to-service communication

#### Data Sanitization
- Automatic redaction of sensitive fields in logs
- PII removal from error messages
- Secure deletion of temporary files

### 4. Audit and Compliance

#### Comprehensive Audit Logging
- All API operations logged with:
  - User identification
  - Resource accessed
  - Operation performed
  - Timestamp and duration
  - IP address and user agent
  - Success/failure status
- Audit log integrity protection
- Configurable retention policies

#### Compliance Standards
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- CIS Kubernetes Benchmark compliance
- PCI DSS ready (with appropriate configuration)
- GDPR compliance features:
  - Data export functionality
  - Right to erasure support
  - Consent management
  - Data minimization

### 5. Infrastructure Security

#### Container Security
- Non-root container execution
- Read-only root filesystem
- Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Minimal base images (distroless/alpine)
- Regular vulnerability scanning

#### Kubernetes Security
- Network policies for pod-to-pod communication
- Pod Security Standards enforcement
- RBAC for service accounts
- Secrets management using Kubernetes secrets
- Resource quotas and limits

### 6. Monitoring and Alerting

#### Security Monitoring
- Failed authentication attempt tracking
- Unusual API usage pattern detection
- Rate limit violation monitoring
- Security header validation
- Certificate expiration monitoring

#### Security Alerts
- Real-time alerts for:
  - Multiple failed login attempts
  - Privilege escalation attempts
  - Suspicious API patterns
  - Security scan failures
  - Certificate issues

## Security Best Practices

### For Deployment

1. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Use strong secrets
   export JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
   export DB_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 24)
   
   # Enable all security features
   export SECURITY_HEADERS_ENABLED=true
   export RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
   export AUDIT_LOGGING_ENABLED=true
   ```

2. **TLS Configuration**
   ```yaml
   # Minimum TLS version
   TLS_MIN_VERSION: "1.2"
   
   # Strong cipher suites only
   TLS_CIPHER_SUITES:
     - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
     - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
   ```

3. **Database Security**
   - Use encrypted connections (sslmode=require)
   - Rotate database credentials regularly
   - Implement database-level audit logging
   - Use read-only replicas for reporting
